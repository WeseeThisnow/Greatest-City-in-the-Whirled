Have you ever had those days when you wake up and ask: Which masque should I wear today? Who am I today? Which costume should I don? What gauntlet am I running today? 

I have.

As I come up out of the deep, sometimes I see the sky, sometimes only the clouds. Sometimes bright golds, sometimes dark purples. No matter what happened in the past, consciousness continues. 

I awake, as best I can, day by day, to see what happens next. 

Some days I can see through the masques of others, and I can adapt as necessary. Other days, my own masque obscures my sight, and the only hope is to fumble forward, as best I can. 

How many versions of me are there? How many of you? Are they countable, discrete, or continuous, infinite? Are you ready to run that gauntlet or perhaps ready to throw it down all together? What does your inner animal say â€“ the instinctual one, without the masque?
