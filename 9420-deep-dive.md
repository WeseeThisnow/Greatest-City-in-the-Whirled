In the sea of everything, sometimes we have just a clue, and put on our brave face and forge ahead. Sometimes we see only a small light on the horizon and need to trust our general directionality. Sometimes we are truly consumed by the chaos of the material world. And sometimes we just need to pray.

Sometimes itâ€™s hard to tell which is which. 

There is the swirl of formlessness, and the shaping into form. There is the ripple of confusion, and the calm of the distance. How deep is the well? How long is infinity? 

Living is a deep dive. Eventually, the end of duality. You just keep swimming. There is beauty, there is struggle. Find a center, let the swirl recede, and see what emerges.
