Sometimes the macro is obvious, but the micro isn’t. Sometimes you know something is true, even if you have no “proof.” Sometimes, if you spend enough time, you can see the differences in the details, the variations hiding in plain sight, “invisible” only because of our patterns of perception. 

Then there are the decisions about how to interpret what we see. Blue can be warm or cold, your choice. Brown can be the welcome solidity of the earth, or a great river of repulsive crap. If patterns of perception limit what we see, what are the limits to our meaning-making? 

You can look for differences between two things, two images, two teams, two people, but after some integration time, aren’t there more similarities than differences, mostly? The shadings are different, the structural organizations vary, you might have preferences for one or the other… Though, as Ram Dass liked to say: The spiritual path is easier if you don’t have any preferences.
