Sometimes, in the grind of the work day, you can sense, in the distance, a form of creativity, your own creativity, that is perhaps possible. 

Maybe, if you can see through the fog, past the structures of society, into the blue purple haze of the future next, maybe we can live there, now, forever, rekindling our passions long dulled by our mundane work in the physical plane and all that that entails. 

This creativity, this future, this idyl — it’s our Self, beyond our selves, more than technology, more than tools, more than any one thing, it is every thing. Available to us, if we want, when we want. Can you touch it? Can you smell it? Breathe, breathe in the air. Don’t be afraid to care.
