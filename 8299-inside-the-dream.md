The first time I visited Peruvian Amazonia, I had a four-part multi-day dream that lasted most of the 12 days I was present.

In the first part of the dream (Q1) I arrive important, large in the field. It’s edgy, and feels a little dangerous, I’m alert. Our destination required a 90 minute boat ride on the Amazon river, with ample time for pirates, real and imagined, though we did see three double rainbows along the journey.

As the dream proceeds, I become smaller, and seemingly shapeshift into a new form (Q2). One or two nights in a screened hut in the rainforest jungle, surrounded by the songs and sounds of uncountable unknown species, and a dark, dark sky, offers plenty of evidence suggesting we might reconsider our place in the animal hierarchy. 

In a further unfolding (Q3), the shaman’s song demonstrates that the masks we wear are a choice, and there are many of both to be had. At the individual level, our masks reflect our place in the social hierarchy. They drive our choices in an attempt to maintain a stable sense of self. Maya is a powerful illusion. 

Finally, the night before departing (Q4) it becomes clear that there is a unified whole, that we are an integral part of it, and that all arises from everything, and nothing it all. 

#8299, the third quad in the collection, reminds us that we might choose to dream the dreams that propel us forward. Carefully choose our masks — they define who we are, and who we can dream ourselves to be. Feel the unified wholeness where are all present and everything is possible.
