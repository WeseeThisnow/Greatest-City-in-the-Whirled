I remember one night in Peru, with a few others, lying on my back on the second floor of the maloca, approaching midnight. The ceremony was complete, the shaman had left for the night. There were a couple of guards downstairs, but otherwise we were alone, as always, with our minds. It was lightly windy, and the round structure, maybe forty feet in diameter and fifteen feet off the ground, was open nearly all around, deep in the Amazon rainforest jungle, truly the middle of nowhere. We heard vast colonies of insects humming, small sticks breaking under the feet of a jaguar, dozens of birds we’ve never heard before or since. 

Just then, the sound of a hundred tiny horses galloping toward us, very, very quickly. Ummm, exhale, ummm, just part of the dream. Until, no, whooooooooosh, the sound flew directly above my face, from left to right. It circled the large room, and flew above me again, from right to left. The sound circled outside the building once or twice, before suddenly returning inside and circling us again. Then, I heard a new sound, a screech, and I realized immediately, these weren’t imaginary sounds; it wasn’t just part of the dream. It was thirty or forty bats flying inches above our faces, the wind of their wings breezing my beard. 

The person next to me whispered, “What should we do?” And I quietly replied, “Close your eyes, be as still as possible, and breathe shallow.” They flew around two or three more times, screeching all the time now, hunting for their insect supper. Having had their fill, they flew away. 

This image quad reminds me of the sound pressure waves that a colony of bats produces up close and personal. It’s quite memorable, if you get the opportunity to experience it.
