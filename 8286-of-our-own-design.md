Have you ever felt that the only thing messin’ with you was you? Sometimes it seems like we construct, from scratch, the perfect set of prison bars designed exactly such that we ourselves can’t escape.  

On one side of the bars is protection from the harsh external world, the city whirled out there. On the other side of the bars is a tender complexity of interior mind, a city of its own in here. 

Maybe if we can at least see each side of the bars, both perspectives informing our understanding, a possibility exists of seeing through them, rendering them invisible.
