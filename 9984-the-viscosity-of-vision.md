Is it an eagle flying through air, or a turtle gliding through water? Or perhaps the eagle is in the water and the turtle in the air? If you see only one, where do the imagined similarities end? If you see both, where do the perceived similarities begin? 

What else do you see? More than one object? Within a single image? Or across a pair? Or across the whole quad? Or is each piece part of a larger story? What stands alone, really? Anything at all? 

Increasing our attention pays dividends in details. We walk through liquid air, we swim in liquid water. Glass is a liquid — you’ve noticed, yes? 

How long can you hold attention, scanning across the image(s)? Can you voluntarily increase the viscosity of your vision, slowing your gaze, integrating more over time, considering other angles, other perspectives? How many of the contradictions can you hold in viewing the images? How many can you hold in your own life?
