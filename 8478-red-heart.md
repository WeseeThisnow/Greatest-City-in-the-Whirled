There’s a movie called “Fantastic Fungi” where they say that every single step you take in the forest or woods activates over 300 miles of mycelium networks. All the mushrooms are connected, invisible, underground, somehow, and above ground through spores. 

Walking through the woods you know where you’ll see them, on dead trees, felled and rotting on their sides, mushrooms thriving. Poking up through the leaves on the ground, staying a hidden secret as long as possible. Bright white ones. Vivid orange ones. Striped turkey tails. Simple shelf shrooms, reaching for the sun. Once you start looking, they’re everywhere. A childlike curiosity for seeking arises, and each new find brings delight, sometimes every twenty seconds on a casual walk. It’s beautiful, this symbiosis of heartfelt connection. 

Mushrooms can be “heart openers,” a way to connect with yourself. Not all mushrooms of course; some are deadly, so it’s best to avoid those. But some of the other mushrooms can provide an expansion of our palate, of our perception, of our perspective. Find those mushrooms, and expand your heart, your love, your longing. 

When you find yourself out walking in the woods, let your heart guide you to the unexpected.
