There’s always a next step. Sometimes the step leads toward an opening. Sometimes a closing. Sometimes we know where the step leads. Sometimes we don’t. Sometimes we take a step, and, whoops, take a step back! And another, take another, step back. 

 Each step of our lives we’re initiated into our own school of mastery and mystery. It could be magic, it could be mayhem. Might be a miracle, it might be a majestic. We walk, step by step, forward mostly, sometimes backward, passing through the keyhole of what’s next. 

How do we know? What’s the correct “What’s Next?” to select? Some of the dark corners turn out to be exciting! Some of the sunny futures turn dark faster than seems possible. 

Look for signposts. Recognize the ones that resonate. Rush from the ones that repel. Don’t stop stepping, keep moving forward.
