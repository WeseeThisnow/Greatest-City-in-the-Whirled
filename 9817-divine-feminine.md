There are angels in the architecture, everywhere. What if we saw the angels more than the architecture? What if miracles are available everywhere, open to us always? 

Modern capitalism has become over-masculinized. Itâ€™s understandable, because we need the masculine to survive. Yet it's too bad, because we also need the feminine to thrive. Sometimes masculinity overpowers, seems to discourage, disenfranchise, even demean, the feminine. 

This instinct arises from fear. We are born of women, who bear us, feed us, nurture us. Women hold the power of survival, of life itself, in their hands. That is real power, and it can be unconsciously terrifying for those who are under the illusion that they are the rulers of their own mortal universe. 

Heal the world by integrating the masculine and feminine. Set them equal, both equally valuable, with different, yet complementary strengths and weaknesses. Both of the same consciousness, both of prior unity. Both necessary for survival and both for everything that makes life worth living.
