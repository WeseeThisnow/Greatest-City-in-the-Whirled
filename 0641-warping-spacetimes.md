Are we moving forward or backward? Attracted or repelled? At what point does time collapse altogether? Without a linear conception of time, stories collapse. Who would we be without our story? How would we know? 

Things often feel linear, one foot in front of the other, this before that, old before new. But that’s just because we’re inhabiting bodies, bound by time, between birth and death. Things can move much faster than that. In fact, some might say they are moving faster than that, and we can see it if we pay attention. Paying attention in the right way, with intention. See the progression and the recession of life occurring simultaneously. Slow time down and see every now anew. 

Live now in the eternal present with the universe expanding and exploding every moment right before our very eyes. Linearity is a myth, as, perhaps we might find, is our story.
