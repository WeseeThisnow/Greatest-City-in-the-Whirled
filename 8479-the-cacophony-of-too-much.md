One time, in 1989 or 1990, I think, we had been at Madison Square Garden for a Grateful Dead show. One of six, or nine, I forget, over a week or two. This particular night, there may have been some lysergic acid diethylamide involved. I can’t be sure, but that’s one way to account for the situation.

After the show, when the houselights came up and we found that our spaceships had returned to the pod, we slowly gathered our things to slowly make our way slowly to The World Outside. We could never possibly move slow enough, really, as it was quite a shock, hitting Seventh Avenue cold like that, from inside the warm comfort of a multi-hued harmonic hypersonic space pod just moments, mere seconds, before. 

I didn’t really have time to actually see anything, to comprehend the situation, because it was all we could do to keep the group together as a unit in the NYC chaos of the post-show street scene of hustlers and harlequins and humanoids. We walked and walked and walked, seemingly forever, but it turned out to be just ten blocks, before we got to Times Square and stopped, still, to look, and to see. 

We stayed there for a while, staring, processing, taking it all in. Pure sensory data, face-melt division, reporting for duty, ser. 

This image quad reminds me of that particular moment in time, when I stopped very still, and really looked to see all that was happening.
