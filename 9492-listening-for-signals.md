When I was 17 I worked in the control room of a commercial television station. Lots of wires, knobs, blinking lights, displays, faders, screens. Certainly the coolest job in my high school cohort. That summer, during our two-week family vacation, we made arrangements to visit other television stations along our journey and watch them deliver the six o’clock news from behind the scenes. This was the 1970s in America, a simpler time, when the three news networks helped sew society together into a more coherent, though much less expansive, unity of thought. 

Broadcasting. Casting broadly. What ideas do we cast to the world? And how? Art? Music? Images? Moving images? The depth and nuance of the spoken word? Some of the ideas are internal, for our own benefit. Other ideas are externalized, for the benefit of others – and, perhaps, sometimes, for the benefit of ourselves, pretending it’s for others. How do we cohere with the larger whole? Can we be expansive, and aligned? 

What signals do we send? What do our signals sound like? Have you seen them? What are the signals we internalize without even knowing they’re there? 

Who are we listening to? Only others? Only our inner voices? Only experts? Only our tribe? 

What are we listening for? Specific signals, perhaps? Or signals more broadly, that we’re required to interpret? 

How do we listen? For depth? For details? For interconnectedness? 

Many things to consider.
