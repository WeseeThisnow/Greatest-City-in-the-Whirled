Some events are life-changing. We were traveling by boat down the Amazon, 90 minutes deep into the rainforest jungle of Peru. The twelve people in a small boat with a big engine raced around a corner and narrowly avoided a crop of very large leafy trees rising out of the water. Above the roar of the engine my wife leaned over and said, “We could die!!” And I replied, “Yup! Could totally die!” 

Later we learned that the water level of the Amazon varies by 30-40 feet seasonally, so that in a few weeks that spot would be a nicely-shaded courtyard for the summer, until the water rose again next year. We took a boating shortcut, while the water was high. 

That first night, in the dark dark darkness, under stars brighter than we’d ever seen, we drank the brew, and waited, shaman singing Shipibo songs. The minutes stretching into hours, which, in turn, stretched through eternities. 

Grandmother Sea Turtle, which my wife believes is the best expression of this collection to date, represents the ever-changing nature of reality we’ve experienced – remembering the shapeshifting face of the shaman who healed an autoimmune disease; the energy grids that simultaneously pinned you to the mat and swept you away for hours; the lines, which I felt more than I saw, that connected me, at a cellular, a molecular level, to every other living thing on the planet; the grin of the trickster who showed me a rolodex of every moment of fear I’d ever experienced; and the bejeweled mechanical seahorses that construct everything we think we know.

What would it mean to die in a place where no one knows who you are, or where you are? But isn’t that why we’d gone? To peel away those parts of our selves that needed to die, so we could more freely live? There were nights we were both convinced that we were dying, only to awake in the morning, fresh, renewed, alive again. 

Some events are life-changing. Marrying my wife was one. Our visit to Peru was another. A collector holding this quad would be a third. 

May art bring us joy, and connection, and depth.
