Move beyond the walls of a decaying society. Leave brick and mortar behind. Escape to a land where the only limitation is your imagination. You can be wherever you want to be, and create anything you want, whatever your heart desires. Nostalgia for ye olde world is fine, though you’re not required to remain.

Ignore the present crumbling. There’s no need for the status of things. The limits are imaginary, so perhaps imagine the limitless. Pixels are free, organize them as you wish. Color them, shape them, combine them, and delete them. You are in control now. It’s your turn.

In the distance, a bit vague in the fog, you can see where you’re going. It’s not clear, yet, but you’re moving so fast now, the focus changes quickly. The air is so pure, you can smell the crispness, ionized, like the air after a rain, outdoors in the mist.
