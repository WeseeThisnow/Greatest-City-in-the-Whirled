It’s hard to describe how quickly you can land in this state of mind, just a couple of seconds, even before you exhale the vapor, the entire world fractionalizing, fractalizing, complete loss of ego, eyes open, eyes closed, it doesn’t matter, it’s all an energy field, our “senses” are so limited, “reality” lol, I always thought that dying would be a fade to black, but what if it’s a fade to color, every color, photons swirling, dancing, never still, ego gave up grasping, still alive, “me,” breathing, but none of that matters, the body persists until it doesn’t, has nothing to do with anything, I heard Michael Row the Boat Ashore when I was young, and again now — when?, then?, now?, again?, is it like this for everyone?, so many paradoxes, everything happening all at once, lasting forever, gone in an instant, over in fifteen minutes, space is vast, huge territories of everything, all contained in me, a speck in the universe, forever, now, infinity, from me, to we, to be, a prayer, yes.

As the dream was fading, lying on the floor, I felt the urge to stretch — I slowly sat up, and reached my arms toward my toes. Much to my surprise, I was able to stretch so far that my forearms were past my toes, nearly to my elbows. “Whoa!,” I exclaimed. Dr. D turned and said, “What?!?” And I said, “I’ve never stretched this far before…” He smiled and said, “Oh, do you think you have ‘short hamstrings?’” 

“I’ve never touched my toes before, so this stretch is crazy! It feels so good, but am I tearing my muscles here?” Dr. D said, “No, no, it’s all neurology dude — your muscles can do that just fine, but your mind sets its own limits. You’re not doing any damage, but you won’t be able to do it again in ten minutes.”

He was right — twenty minutes later I was standing up, and could no longer reach my toes, just like normal, just like all the other times except today, when I experienced that I could in fact stretch past my toes, nearly to my elbows. The mind does appear to set its own limits.
