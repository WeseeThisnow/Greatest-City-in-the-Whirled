When I was eight, and nine, my family volunteered for two summers on a pueblo Indian reservation in New Mexico, United States. We lived inside the reservation, the only White people for miles, true minorities. It was exciting, and humbling. 

The other kids played with us, sort of, but we weren’t “like them” and somehow that was clear, even in my eight year old mind. They did things we outsiders weren’t allowed to do. It was lonely. I spent a lot of time looking at the huge sky, the desert dirt, the dust clouds, rain in the distance. 

I didn’t have the words for it then, but looking back on it now those two summers deeply influenced my sense of spirituality. The pueblo culture felt spiritual in a way I hadn’t experienced in Episcopalian churches growing up. The relationship we have to nature, to the seasons, to the earth, to all creatures — I was entrained to a different rhythm, a different possibility space.  

The colors of this image quad remind me of the clay earth, some of the pottery glazes, and the turquoise jewelry we saw over those two summers. Like the desert, these images respond best to detailed observation, contemplating the subtle changes over time.
